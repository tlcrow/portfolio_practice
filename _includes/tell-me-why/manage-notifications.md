## Managing Notifications
Once you've commented on an _issue_ or _pull request_, email notifications will start to pour in. By default, notifications will be sent by email when there is activity in the thread.  
You can also choose to receive notifications of a full repository. Whenever there is a new _issue_, _pull request_ or _comment_ posted you will get a notification.

### You can silence or unmute notifications of _individual issues and pull requests_.

1. Go to the issue or pull request.
2. Click the **(Un)subscribe** button on the right, under _Notifications_  
Underneath the button a short description explains the current notification status.

### You can _customize_ notifications in Settings.

1. Click your profile icon.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Click **Notifications** from the menu on the left.  
Here you can adjust your notification [preferences](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-delivery-methods/).

### You can choose to receive notifications from a _repository_.

* _**Watch**_: You will receive a notification when a **new** _issue_, _pull request_ or _comment_ is posted, and when an _issue_ is **closed** or a _pull request_ is **merged**.  
* _**Not watching**_: Stop receiving notifications, but @ mentions will still alert you.  
* _**Ignore**_: Stops all notifications.  

### You can _review notifications_ for the repositories you are already watching.

1. Click your profile icon.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Click **Notification** from the menu on the left.
4. Click on the [repositories youâ€™re watching](https://github.com/watching) link.
5. Select the **Watching** tab.
6. Click the **(Un)watch** button to disable or enable notifications for that repository.
