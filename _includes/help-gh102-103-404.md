#### 404 error
Somewhere down the cascade of tests **Travis CI** will check if the URL following `pageUrl` actually exists. The test and the complete build will fail if a website does not exist (a "404 error").

It is possible you might have mistyped your URL or something went wrong when you tried to publish your website. It is also possible that users who previously merged their branch with the master have sadly deleted their repository and their website disappeared.

Try and discover in the log which URL is causing a 404 error. You can double check whether the website exist by copying it into your browser.

Because you are working in your own branch it is safe to change the code however you like. If you see something that can be fixed easily you could just edit the offending file. For instance you can replace the broken URL with something that does exist (e.g. `github.com`).
A more rigorous solution would be to delete the file altogether.

Once your fix is correct and the build is no longer failing, you are ready to merge your branch with the `master`. You might get some merge conflicts you will need to address first. Ask `@githubteacher` if you get stuck.
