  ## Get Ready to Mutate

  ![animated gif of instructions outlined below](../images/gifs/graphql/recent-contributions.gif)

  1. Using the response from the query in the last step, fill in this template.

          My most recent contributions are to: <br>
          1. [repository1](url1)<br>
          1. [repository2](url2)<br>
          1. [repository3](url3)<br>
          1. [repository4](url4)<br>
          1. [repository5](url5)<br>


  1. Save this template somewhere where you can get to it later, like a text editor or as a comment in an issue.

  ### Why are we making this file?

  Maybe you are a trying to land a job and want to show your potential employer the projects that you work on. Maybe you already have a job, but you want to be able to show your team or manager what you have been working on recently.

  You can use this query to automatically generate a list of the projects that you are actively contributing to.

  For this course, we are going to use this information in our first **mutation**.
