  **Essential First Step:** Before this class, you should complete our [Introduction to GitHub](../intro-to-github/) course.

  This course teaches you to create and host your own website via GitHub, using Git in the command line.

  **In this course, you will learn how to:**

  - Create a new repository
  - Work with your repository on your local machine
  - Convert your repository into a website
  - Host and share your website

  **Take a look at everyone who has shared their website so far:**

  <div class="contribution_graph">
  <div id="github_chart_1" class="github_chart_1"></div>
  </div>
