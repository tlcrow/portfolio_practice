  Although we were able to resolve the merge conflicts we encountered in this course within the GitHub user interface, sometimes we need to resolve merge conflicts locally. This section is going to outline how merge conflicts can be resolved in text editors like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).

  You can find links to these walkthroughs on the navigation bar in this course.

  Have a favorite tool and want to add a guide on how to handle merge conflicts in it? Contribute to the [GitHub Training Kit](https://github.com/github/training-kit) repository.
