  Using Git on Microsoft Windows isn't difficult, this course was created to help new or inexperienced users from Windows get up and running with Git as quickly as possible. Although this course **will** identify how to install and configure Git to work on your computer, it **will not** go into a typical workflow, those instructions can be found in the following classes available on the GitHub Training On Demand website:

  - [GitHub 101: Introduction to GitHub](../intro-to-github/)
  - [GitHub 102: Using GitHub Desktop](../github-desktop/)
  - [GitHub 103: Using the Command Line](../github-cli/)
  - [Git Out of Trouble](../git-trouble)

  Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate through the different setup and configuration steps.
