  Most commonly, Electron apps are shared via [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/). People who create and package their own applications upload the binaries to a GitHub repository where others can download them. You can see some great examples of this on the [Electron App page](https://electron.atom.io/apps/). This is free, version controlled, and kept cleanly alongside your code.

  Once you [create your release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), link to your downloads from your website! We recommend [GitHub Pages](../../github-cli/) if you don't have a website yet.
