  Here are some resources for sharing the apps in their native stores. However, instead of walking through this process with the app we built earlier, we'll show you these resources and move on to a how-to of getting the app up and ready for download from a website.

  - **Apple** has the [Mac App Store](https://www.apple.com/ca/osx/apps/app-store/). Read up on [Electron's guide for Mac App Store Submission](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md), or Apple's own [guide](
  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/SubmittingYourApp/SubmittingYourApp.html).
  - **Windows** has the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/apps?rtc=1). There's also an [Electron guide for the Windows Store](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/windows-store-guide.md), and Microsoft also keeps an [application submission checklist for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/app-submissions).
  - **Linux** has [Ubuntu Apps Directory](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/) and [Deepin App Store](http://appstore.deepin.com/).
