So I have a packaged app, now what? How to get apps onto the app store and easy to download.


## Legal things to be aware of
- Once you're sharing your app, your licenses and other legal things need to be in order
   - App submission checklist for Windows (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/app-submissions)


## Native App Discovery
- [General docs on application distribution](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-distribution.md)
- Apple has app store...[See Mac App Store Submission Guide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md)
- Windows has the [Windows Store]( (https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/apps?rtc=1))...[See Windows Store Guide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/windows-store-guide.md)
- Linux has Ubuntu Apps Directory (https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/) and Deepin App Store (http://appstore.deepin.com/)
