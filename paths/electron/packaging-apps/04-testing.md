  Now that you've created and packaged the application for many operating systems, you may want to ensure that the app will work as expected. The obvious way to do this is to share it with yourself or someone you trust who has access to that operating system and try it manually. However, there are other ways to do this.

  We won't walk through the steps of setting up testing in this tutorial. However, [Spectron](https://electron.atom.io/spectron/) is the Electron community's preferred way to test Electron apps. Spectron's [source code](https://github.com/electron/spectron) is also kept on GitHub.
