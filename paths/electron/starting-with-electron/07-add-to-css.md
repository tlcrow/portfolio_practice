  Just like with the `src/index.html` file, now we will copy the contents for the CSS. [Here's an example of a commit doing just that](https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-electron-app/commit/c1cc4bac87449d27d15a10c5c890467c41c56e5e).

  ![gif of following the directions below](<% SITEURL %><% BASEURL %>/images/gifs/electron/electron1-add-css.gif)

  1. Copy the contents of the `css` tab on Codepen into the `src/style.css` file.
  1. Spin up the app with `npm start` and see how things look different. There should be style now, but you should still be unable to play the game.
  1. Quit the app by pressing Ctrl + C in your Command Line Interface.
  1. Save and commit your changes.
