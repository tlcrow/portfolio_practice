<p>Our own Tim Berglund brings some slightly humorous, very useful advanced Git instruction at a conference in Norway in September 2012. Tim performs a commit without using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code> operations, demonstrates various forms of rebasing, shows powerful log options, and more.</p>
