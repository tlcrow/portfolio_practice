## Packaging for Viewing Behind Your Firewall

If you'd like to have a copy of the files to be served from a web server inside of your firewall, start by running `script/package`.

1. Run `script/package` to create a release tarball. This will be in the format `release-XXXXXXX.tgz` for you to take wherever you want.
2. To test this looks okay, create some folders `mkdir -p test_site/kit`.
3. Untar the release, `tar -xzf release-XXXXXXX.tgz -C test_site/kit`.
4. Switch into the test_site directory, `cd test_site`.
5. View the site with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. _Note: Some servers are obviously more advanced than others and can handle redirects, smart recognition of `.html` files, etc_
